Notes on the Clipper Library (ver 4).

This is currently an early beta release and is a major rewrite of earlier versions.

Potential issues of robustness have been addressed. Consequently, floating point values are no longer used except for storing edge slope values. Slope comparisons (the only time floating point values are compared) will potentially affect edge sort order within 'scanbeams', but this should not affect the robustness of the library. 

Another benefit of changing to integer coordinates from floating point coordinates is a signficant (~25%) improvement in typical execution times.

Since floating point coordinates are no longer used, it's now up to the user to 'scale up' values with fractional coordinates into integer values, though keeping in mind that on most platforms integers are still confined to 32bits.

The code that sorts out the orientation of output polygons, while close is isn't yet perfect. This remains a work-in-progress. Likewise, code for merging output polygons that share common edges is still to come.

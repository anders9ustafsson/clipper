C++ code sample:

	#include "clipper.hpp"

	using namespace clipper;

	Clipper c;
	TPolygon subject, clip;
	TPolyPolygon solution;

	subject.push_back(FloatPoint(20,20));
	subject.push_back(FloatPoint(220,20));
	subject.push_back(FloatPoint(120,220));

	clip.push_back(FloatPoint(120,20));
	clip.push_back(FloatPoint(200,250));
	clip.push_back(FloatPoint(40,250));

	c.AddPolygon(subject, ptSubject);
	c.AddPolygon(clip, ptClip);
	c.Execute(ctIntersection, solution);

	for (unsigned i = 0; i < solution.size(); i++) {
		//do somthing with the solution[i]
	}

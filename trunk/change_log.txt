Clipper Change Log
============================================================

2.6 - 23 October 2010
* Bugfix: A couple of obscure bugs fixed.

2.522 - 15 October 2010
* Added C# translation (thanks to Olivier Lejeune) and 
  a link to Ruby bindings (thanks to Mike Owens).

2.521 - 8 October 2010
* Bugfix: Minor bug in the cleaning up of empty polygon 
          results (affected C++ code only).

2.52 - 24 September 2010
* Revert: Tolerance in SlopesEqual() function reverted as some 
          users found the sub-pixel 'smoothing' unacceptable.
* Update: Minor code tidy. 

2.5 - 10 September 2010
* Update: Variable tolerance (epsilon) implemented to further 
          address issues of 'robustness' that are inherent to 
          floating point calulations.

2.4 - 2 September 2010
* Bugfix: Obscure bug fixed. 
* Update: Performance improvement (thanks to Kirill Gavrilov).

2.36 - 27 August 2010
* Bugfix: Minor bugfix. 

2.35 - 23 August 2010
* Update: Simplified some very convoluted code in AddPolygon().

2.3 - 21 August 2010
* Update: Better clean-up of extraneous edges in solution polygons.

2.22 - 11 August 2010
* Bugfix: Further code tidy up and fix bug added in ver 2.2. 

2.2 - 14 August 2010
* Change: Precision property removed from Clipper class.

2.11 - 11 August 2010
* Bugfix: Another minor bugfix. 

2.10 - 10 August 2010
* Bugfix: Fixed one bug but introduced another in ver 2.08.
* Change: DuplicatePointTolerance() renamed Precision().
* Change: ForceAlternateOrientation() renamed ForceOrientation().

2.08 - 7 August 2010
* Bugfix: Bug in BuildBound() could cause an endless loop. 

2.06 - 5 August 2010
* Bugfix: Finally nailed an obscure but elusive bug in the 
merging of co-linear edges in the input polygons where 
very rarely one would be missed.

2.03 - 3 August 2010
* Bugfix: A couple of minor bugs fixed.

2.02 - 2 August 2010
* Bugfix: BuildResult() very occasionally caused an endless loop. 

2.0 - 30 July 2010
* Clipper now clips using both the Even-Odd (alternate) and 
  Non-Zero (winding) polygon filling rules. (Previously Clipper 
  assumed the Even-Odd rule for polygon filling.)
  
1.4s - 11 July 2010
* Bugfix: Some code in BuildResult() in clipper.cpp was being 
  executed out of order.

1.4r - 10 July 2010
* Bugfix: The returned orientation of polygons 
  (clockwise vs counter-clockwise) was not always correct. 
* Improvement: Removed occasional overlapping co-linear segments 
  (empty spikes) from result polygons. 

1.4m - 3 July 2010
* Added DuplicatePointTolerance() to Clipper class
* Very minor tweaks to clipping algorithm

1.4i - 18 June 2010
* Minor improvements to C++ code
  
1.4e - 17 June 2010
* Bugfix: Clipper.pas & Clipper.cpp
  
1.4c - 16 June 2010
* Added C++ support for AGG graphics library 
  
1.4  - 15 June 2010
* Added Delphi support for AGG graphics library
  
1.3  - 9 June 2010
* Added clipper.dll (& support files) to provide any Windows 
  application with to access Clipper's functionality.
* Code tidying. 
  
1.2u - 3 June 2010
* Bugfix: In clipper.cpp, there was inadequate clean-up in
  the Execute method.

1.2s - 2 June 2010
* Minor code tidy up.
* Added C++ translation of clipper.pas

1.2n - 30 May 2010
* Minor bug in the 'uses' clause fixed.

1.2m - 28 May 2010
* Minor code tidy up.
* Demo application updated.

1.2i - 23 May 2010
* Minor code tidy up.
* Demo application updated.

1.2e - 21 May 2010
* Added ForceAlternateOrientation property to TClipper class.
  This property is only useful when operating on 'simple' 
  polygons. It ensures that the result of the TClipper
  Execute method will be (simple) polygons with clockwise  
  'outer' and counter-clockwise 'inner' (or 'hole') polygons. 
  Note: there is no danger in enabling this property when 
  operating on complex polygons. The only downside is a 
  very minor penalty in execution speed. (Default = true)
* Minor code tidy up.

1.2c - 17 May 2010

1.0 - 9 May 2010

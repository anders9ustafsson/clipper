1.2e - 21 May 2010
* Added ForceAlternateOrientation property to TClipper class.
  This property is only useful when operating on 'simple' 
  polygons. It ensures that the result of the TClipper
  Execute method will be (simple) polygons with clockwise  
  'outer' and counter-clockwise 'inner' (or 'hole') polygons. 
  Note: there is no danger in enabling this property when 
  operating on complex polygons. The only downside is a 
  very minor penalty in execution speed. (Default = false)
* Minor code tidy up.

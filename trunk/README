Clipper Change Log
============================================================

v3.1.0 - 17 February 2011
* Bugfix: Obscure bug in TClipperBase.SetDx method that caused 
  problems with very small edges ( edges <1/1000th pixel in size).
  
v3.0.3 - 9 February 2011
* Bugfix: Significant bug, but only in C# code.
* Update: Minor refactoring.

v3.0 - 31 January 2011
* Update: Major rewrite of the portion of code that calculates 
  the output polygons' orientation.
* Update: Help file significantly improved.
* Change: Renamed ForceOrientation property to IgnoreOrientation. 
  If the orientation of output polygons is not important, or can 
  be managed separately, clipping routines can be sped up by about 
  60% by setting IgnoreOrientation to true. Defaults to false.
* Change: The OffsetPolygon and Area functions have been moved to 
  the new unit - clipper_misc. 

2.99 - 15 January 2011
* Bugfix: Obscure bug in AddPolygon method could cause an endless loop. 

2.8 - 20 November 2010
* Updated: Output polygons which previously shared a common 
  edge are now merged. 
* Changed: The orientation of outer polygons is now clockwise 
  when the display's Y axis is positive downwards (as is 
  typical for most Windows applications). Inner polygons 
  (holes) have the opposite orientation.
* Added: Support module for Cairo Graphics Library (with demo). 
* Updated: C# and C++ demos.

2.522 - 15 October 2010
* Added C# translation (thanks to Olivier Lejeune) and 
  a link to Ruby bindings (thanks to Mike Owens).

2.0 - 30 July 2010
* Clipper now clips using both the Even-Odd (alternate) and 
  Non-Zero (winding) polygon filling rules. (Previously Clipper 
  assumed the Even-Odd rule for polygon filling.)
  
1.4c - 16 June 2010
* Added C++ support for AGG graphics library 
  
1.2s - 2 June 2010
* Added C++ translation of clipper.pas

1.0 - 9 May 2010
